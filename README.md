# Health Insurance Cost Prediction (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** completed as part of my internship with  
**Global Next Consulting India Private Limited (GNCIPL)**.

The aim of this project is to study the **Health Insurance dataset** and understand how different factors such as **Age, BMI, Smoker status, and Region** influence medical charges.

## 🎯 Objectives
The project focuses on the following EDA areas:
- **Age** → Impact of increasing age on medical charges  
- **BMI** → Relationship between BMI and charges  
- **Smoker status** → Comparison of charges between smokers and non-smokers  
- **Region** → Observing differences in charges across regions

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Smoker status** is the strongest factor — smokers pay significantly higher charges than non-smokers.  
- **Age** shows a positive correlation — older people tend to have higher charges.  
- **BMI** also correlates positively — higher BMI is linked with higher charges.  
- **Region** shows some differences, but much smaller compared to smoking, age, and BMI.
